Summary of Weaknesses

We successfully found several critical vulnerabilities that should be immediately addressed in order to prevent an adversary from compromising the network. These findings are not specific to a software version but are more general and systemic vulnerabilities.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities: Multiple instances of XSS vulnerabilities were discovered, posing a high risk of unauthorized code execution and potential data theft or manipulation.
Command Injection Vulnerabilities: The image upload functionality and other components were found to be vulnerable to command injection attacks, enabling arbitrary command execution and potential system compromise.
SQL Injection Vulnerabilities: The login page and potentially other sections of the website were susceptible to SQL injection, which could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or database manipulation.
Unauthorized Access and Privilege Escalation: Weak or easily guessable credentials, misconfigured permissions, and vulnerabilities in various services allowed unauthorized access and potential privilege escalation, exposing sensitive data and compromising system integrity.
Information Leakage: Information leakage was observed through the DomainDossier tool, potentially providing attackers with valuable insights for further exploitation or reconnaissance.
Unprotected Docker Containers: Vulnerabilities in the Docker container running the CTF website allowed unauthorized access to the system, emphasizing the need for secure exploitation container configurations and regular updates.
Vulnerabilities in Network Services: Vulnerabilities in SLMail services and other network services were identified, posing a high risk of unauthorized access, information disclosure, or compromise of the affected systems.
Weak Password Storage and Hash Cracking: Weak password storage practices were evident, leading to the extraction of password hashes. However, the cracking of these hashes was not successful, highlighting the importance of strong password storage mechanisms.



Addressing these weaknesses and vulnerabilities is crucial to fortify the system's security. Remediation efforts should focus on implementing secure coding practices, input validation and sanitization, strong access controls, regular patching and updates, secure container configurations, and password policies that enforce strong and unique passwords.
